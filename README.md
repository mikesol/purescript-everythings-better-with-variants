# everythings-better-with-variants

A package using variants to represent various popular `data` types.

## Why?

For libraries designed to be called from code written in JS or TS, it's useful for all types to be duck typed (no `instanceof`, etc.). Variants have great duck-typing, which make them more suitable than `data` types.
